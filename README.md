# stock-returns

Python code found in stocks.ipynb for paper 'The $\kappa$-generalised Distribution for Stock Returns', 2024, [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09929) where we fit the distribution of stock returns with the $\kappa$-generalised distribution for FTSE 100 and top 100 Nasdaq stocks.

Note the code fits stock returns from the date run so the results will differ from the paper but a significant proportion of stock returns should still be fitted by the $\kappa$-generalised distribution.
